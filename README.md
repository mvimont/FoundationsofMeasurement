# FoundationsofMeasurement
Transcription of Krantz et al Foundation of Measurement to Python:

https://books.google.com/books?id=aZ3bmPjCc9QC&source=gbs_similarbooks

Purpose: Build out the building blocks of scientific measurement and mathematics into Python code as a fun excercise.

Guidelines:
  (1) Use only the standard library or functions/classes developed in the project
  (2) For generating test cases to prove theorems, use any library you want
  (3) Each subchapter has a narrative python file with comments linking to the book, and a class py file that can be used in higher layers
